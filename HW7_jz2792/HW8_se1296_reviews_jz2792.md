### Plot Clarity: 
   This plot is quite clear and easy to read. However, there should be an explanatory caption. Additionally, the axes should be flipped. As the Currently, the plot suggests that C02 emissions are an independent variable which affect popuation, whereas I would assume the purpose of the plot is to show that CO2 emmissions may be a factor of population size.

### Plot Aesthetic:
   The three variables in the plot are depicted very well. Using points of varying size is a clear way to communicate differences in population density without taking away from the relationship between emissions and population size. The difference in point sizes and number of bins are also good. However, using a different scale and/or range for the axes would have been beneficial as there are a couple of places where the data points are bunched too closely together to easily discern. Representing population density using different colors instead of or in addition to different size points and adjusting the alpha may have solved this issue, but at the same time may be distracting.

### Plot Honesty:
   This plot provides an honest representation of the data, but there is some distortion along each axis due to the usage of logarithmic scales. The plot does clearly state though that the axes are not linear.
